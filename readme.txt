== Installation ==

Firstly make sure that you have the Gutenberg plugin installed.

1. Install the Kona plugin either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your web server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory).
1. Activate the Kona plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
1. Add the Kona block to your editor.
1. Get an Instagram Access Token: To do this we suggest installing the Feed Them Social plugin by Slick Remix, then login to instagram and follow these steps [click here] (https://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-create-instagram-access-token/). Once you have a token, please paste it into the 'Instagram Access Token' setting. You can then deactivate the FTS plugin if needed.
1. Your Instagram feed will now show in the editor, adjust the settings to see how it will look before publishing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My feed isn't showing? =

Please make sure to add your Instagram access token the block settings. Once added your feed should show instantly (well pretty fast at least).

= How about X feature? =

We will continue adding features as requested. If you have a killer idea for a feature submit a support request and we will see what we can do.

= The feed looks funny in IE9 (Or other old browser)

This plugin is laid out using the new CSS Grid specification, we do not have plans to support older browsers as we believe they are holding back the web. However we can (if requested) release some code which you can add to your site's custom css in order to support certain browsers.
